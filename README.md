### Customize the hamburger
By default, the hamburger adopts to its environment pretty good,
the bars scale to fit and inherit their color for the parent element.<br />

### Development
This project uses [Gulp(4)](http://gulpjs.com/) to transpile and minify SCSS to CSS.
If you are unfamiliar with Gulp, check [this tutorial](https://travismaynard.com/writing/getting-started-with-gulp) on how to get started.<br />
Run `gulp watch` in the command-line to put a watch on the files and run all scripts immediately after saving your changes.
